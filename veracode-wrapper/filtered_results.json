In recent years, researchers have demonstrated ways to breach many uses of previously-thought-safe hash functions such as MD5. \u003c/span\u003e \u003cspan\u003eConsider using a stronger algorithm in order to prevent attackers from being able to manipulate hash results. If this algorithm is being used to hash passwords, then consider using a strong computationally-hard algorithm such as PBKDF2 or bcrypt instead of a plain hashing algorithm.\u003c/span\u003e \u003cspan\u003eReferences: \u003ca href\u003d\"https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/327.html\"\u003eCWE\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\n",
